Hello there!

Here I'm trying to render something that looks like infinite terrain without using any assets (like textures, heightmaps, exported models etc.). 

You can see my current progress in https://github.com/Batanick/pong/tree/master/screens . Or take a look at video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s12LkFNt-fA .

PS actually I'm using 1 texture for font rendering, but hope no one will notice ;)

Trees in progress:
